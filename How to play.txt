GUIDE:


CONTROLS:

WASD or arrow keys to move
C to spawn angry circles
X and C to use potions
SPACEBAR to heal


ENEMIES:

Dark red squares are slightly stronger and faster

Yellow squares are a bit stronger and way faster

Orange squares are even stronger but a bit slower

Pink squares are strong speed demons. be careful around them.

Purple squares, unlike the others, are smart and will shoot at you from a distance and move away from you when your too close. use summons to deal with them.

Stronger enemies give more exp



BOSSES:
[Black squares] are boss enemies. They have ALOT of health but they dont do instant touch-damage, they do very low tick damage, however, in most cases it will still out-DPS you. remember to heal!

you cannot see your own hp when inside the black square.

[Black squares] are often accompanied by a large quantity
of [Pink squares]. Beware the [Pink square horde].
