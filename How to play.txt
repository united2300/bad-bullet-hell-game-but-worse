SUMMARY:

You are a blue square.
You are also horribly {motivated by others external colour}.
All the other coloured squares hate you and want to kick you out of the great square village for being a blue-square supremacist.
...However, you know some nice little circles who can help you.
You must slaughter the other coloured squares.
Ram them all to death.



CONTROLS:

Arrow keys or WASD to move
[SPACEBAR] to use [health potions]
[Z] to use [speed potions]
[X] to use [DPS potions]
[C] to summon a friend (0.666 sec cooldown.)

Walk into enemy squares to attack them 
(and get exp if you manage to kill them)
Important: You also take damage when ramming.



PLAYER STATS:
Health: 100
Attack/DPS: 5
Speed: 5

Upon leveling up:
More base stats + stronger summons



ITEMS:

Health potion - heals 20 hp
Speed potion - buffs speed by 0.025 permanently
DPS potion - buffs player attack by 0.25 permanently



ENEMIES:

Red squares are weak and slow. nothing to it.

Dark red squares are slightly stronger and faster than red squares

Yellow squares are a bit stronger and way faster

Orange squares are even stronger but a bit slower

Pink squares are strong speed demons. be careful around them.

Purple squares, unlike the others, are smart and will shoot at you from a distance and move away from you when your too close. use summons to deal with them. (and guess what, they debuff summons too just to spite you :D)

Stronger enemies give more exp



BOSSES:
[Black squares] are boss enemies. They have ALOT of health but they dont do instant touch-damage, instead they do very low tick damage, however, in most cases it will still out-DPS you. remember to heal and move away from the boss when your low on health!

NOTE: you cannot see your own hp when inside the black square.

[Black squares] are often accompanied by a large quantity
of [Pink squares]. Beware the [Pink square horde].
