## Running / Installation guide:

**You need to have both Python and Pygame installed to run this, if you have both, you can just download this entire thing, extract it and run main.py like normal.**

<br>

#### About the game:
Just another bad bullet hell game (But now its worse(er)!!!11!!1!)
The game doesn't really have that great graphics since im currently focusing on the actual functionality of it rather than making some fancy smanchy stuff that'll break the moment i edit absoloutely anything. <br>
Thanks for understanding. <br>

<br>

### Installing Python & Pygame (if you haven't already):
To get Python go here: 
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Then, to get Pygame go to the terminal or commmand prompt and type: 
```pip install pygame```

<br>

### Things still dont work?:
*If for some reason you just cannot run the program* (***and you dont get an error message***) *try going to the Python installer and repairing Python.
If the program still crashes, well, idk too bad i guess you aren't playing the game then (tell me about it and i'll do my best to fix it)*

*If you get an error message after running it, screenshot the error and DM it to me so i can fix it.*
