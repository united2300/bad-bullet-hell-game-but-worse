## Running / Installation guide:

**You need to have both Python and Pygame installed to run this, if you have both, you can just download this entire thing, extract it and run main.py like normal.**

<br>

### Installing Python & Pygame (if you haven't already):
To get Python go here: 
https://www.python.org/downloads/

Then, to get Pygame go to the terminal or commmand prompt and type: 
```pip install pygame```

<br>

### Things still dont work?:
*If for some reason you just cannot run the program* (***and you dont get an error message***) *try going to the Python installer and repairing Python.
If the program still crashes, well, idk too bad i guess you aren't playing the game then (tell me about it and i'll do my best to fix it)*

*If you get an error message after running it, screenshot the error and DM it to me so i can fix it.*
